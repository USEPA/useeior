# Model and Model Component Formats

A fully constructed USEEIO model is an R named list that contains the following members described in the [Model](#model) table. The format members or components are further described in separate tables. 
 
## Notes 
 
 A _sector_ is either a commodity or industry, depending on the [model CommodityorIndustry Type](ModelSpecification.md#model-specifications). The _sector_ will be synononmous for that same CommodityorIndustryType for all tables in a given model in which _sector_ is used. 

Unless another year is specifically called out, all economic values are given in US dollars (USD) in the value the [model IOyear](ModelSpecification.md#model-specifications). 

## Model
