`useeior` is an R package for building and using [USEEIO models](https://www.epa.gov/land-research/us-environmentally-extended-input-output-useeio-models).

The [model object](format_specs/Model.md) is the primary output that is built according to a given [model specification](format_specs/ModelSpecification.md) and optional hybridization specification, e.g. [disaggregation](format_specs/ModelCustomization.md).
[Model specifications](inst/extdata/modelspecs) and associated hybridization specifications, e.g. [disaggregation](inst/extdata/disaggspecs), for EPA-validated models are included in the package.

`useeior` offers various functions for validating, calculating, visualizing, and writing out models and/or their components.
`useeior` is a core component of the [USEEIO Modeling Framework](https://github.com/USEPA/useeio) and is in a stable development state.
Users intending to use the package for production purposes and applications should use [Releases](https://github.com/USEPA/useeior/releases).
`useeior` v1.0.0 was peer-reviewed internally at USEPA and published at Zenodo.

An peer-reviewed article describing `useeior` was published in the journal Applied Sciences in April 2022.

See the following sections for installation and basic usage of `useeior`.

See [Wiki](https://github.com/USEPA/useeior/wiki) for advanced uses, details about built-in data and metadata and how to contribute to `useeior`.

## Installation

```r
# Install development version from GitHub
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("USEPA/useeior")
```

```r
# Install a previously released version (e.g. v1.0.0) from GitHub
devtools::install_github("USEPA/useeior@v1.0.0")
```

See [Releases](https://github.com/USEPA/useeior/releases) for all previously released versions.

## Usage

### Build Model

View all models with existing config files that can be built using useeior

```r
library("useeior")
seeAvailableModels()
```

Build a model that is available in useeior (e.g. the [USEEIOv2.0.1-411](inst/extdata/modelspecs/USEEIOv2.0.1-411.yml) model)

```r
model <- buildModel('USEEIOv2.0.1-411')
```

To build a customized model, refer to [Advanced Uses](https://github.com/USEPA/useeior/wiki/Using-useeior#advanced-uses) in Wiki.

This generates a complete USEEIO model with components described in the [Model](format_specs/Model.md#model) table.

### Adjust Price Year and Type of Model Results

Adjust model results (e.g. `N` matrix) to user-specified price year (e.g. `2018`) and type (producer's or purchaser's).

```r
N_adj <- adjustResultMatrixPrice("N", 
                                 currency_year = 2018,
                                 purchaser_price = TRUE,
                                 model)
```

### Calculate Model LCI and LCIA

Calculate model life cycle inventory (LCI) and life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) results with a user-specified [calculation perspective](format_specs/Calculation.md#calculation-perspectives), [demand vector](format_specs/Model.md#demandvectors) (from `DemandVectors` in the model object, which includes four [default vectors](format_specs/ModelSpecification.md#demand-vector-specifications), or a user-provided vector) and a model [direct requirements matrix](format_specs/Model.md#a).

```r
result <- calculateEEIOModel(model,
                             perspective = "DIRECT",
                             demand = "CompleteProduction",
                             use_domestic_requirements = FALSE)
```

This returns a [Calculation Result](format_specs/Calculation.md#calculation-result). 

### Write Model to File

Write selected model matrices, demand vectors, and metadata as one `.xlsx` file to a given output folder.
```r
writeModeltoXLSX(model, outputfolder)
```

Write model matrices as `.csv` files to a given output folder.
```r
writeModelMatrices(model, to_format = "csv", outputfolder)
```

### Validate Model

Complete model validation checks can be found in [ValidateModel.Rmd](inst/doc/ValidateModel.Rmd).
Knit [ValidateModel_render.Rmd](inst/doc/ValidateModel_render.Rmd) to perform all validation checks on selected models (specified under the [YAML header](inst/doc/ValidateModel_render.Rmd#L5)).
This will generate an `.html` and a `.md` file containing validation results for each model. See example output in  [inst/doc/output/](inst/doc/output). 

#### Examples

Validate that flow totals by commodity `E_c` can be recalculated (within 1%) using the model satellite matrix `B`, market shares matrix `V_n`, total requirements matrix `L`, and demand vector `y` for US production.

```r
> modelval <- compareEandLCIResult(model, tolerance = 0.01)
> print(paste("Number of flow totals by commodity passing:", modelval$N_Pass))
[1] "Number of flow totals by commodity passing: 1118742"
> print(paste("Number of flow totals by commodity failing:", modelval$N_Fail))
[1] "Number of flow totals by commodity failing: 0"
```

Validate that commodity output can be recalculated (within 1%) with the model total requirements matrix `L` and demand vector `y` for US production.

```r
> econval <- compareOutputandLeontiefXDemand(model, tolerance = 0.01)
> print(paste("Number of sectors passing:",econval$N_Pass))
[1] "Number of sectors passing: 409"
> print(paste("Number of sectors failing:",econval$N_Fail))
[1] "Number of sectors failing: 2"
> print(paste("Sectors failing:", paste(econval$Failure$rownames, collapse = ", ")))
[1] "Sectors failing: S00402/US, S00300/US"
```
Note: `S00402/US - Used and secondhand goods` and `S00300/US - Noncomparable imports` are two commodities that are not produced by any industry in the US, therefore their commodity output naturally cannot be recalculated with the model total requirements matrix `L` and demand vector `y` for US production. Results for these sectors are not recommended for use.

### Visualize Model Results

#### Examples

Rank sectors based a composite score of selected total impacts (H_r or H_l) associated with total US demand (US production or consumption vector).
Comparing rankings may also be used as another form of model validation that incorporates the demand vectors and the indicators as well as the model result matrices.

```r
# Calculate model LCIA_d (H_r) and LCIA_f (H_l)
result <- c(calculateEEIOModel(model, perspective = 'DIRECT', demand = "Production"),
            calculateEEIOModel(model, perspective = 'FINAL', demand = "Consumption"))
colnames(result$H_r) <- model$Indicators$meta[match(colnames(result$H_r),
                                                    model$Indicators$meta$Name),
                                                 "Code"]
colnames(result$H_l) <- colnames(result$H_r)
# Define indicators
indicators <- c("ACID", "CCDD", "CMSW", "CRHW", "ENRG", "ETOX", "EUTR", "GHG",
                "HRSP", "HTOX", "LAND", "MNRL", "OZON", "SMOG", "WATR")
# Create figure on the left
heatmapSectorRanking(model,
                     matrix = result$H_r,
                     indicators,
                     sector_to_remove = "",
                     N_sector = 20,
                     x_title = "H_r (DIRECT perspective) & US production demand")
# Create figure on the right
heatmapSectorRanking(model,
                     matrix = result$H_l,
                     indicators,
                     sector_to_remove = "",
                     N_sector = 20,
                     x_title = "H_l (FINAL perspective) & US consumption demand")
```

> head(subset(HHRP_flour, TRUE, select = "contribution"), 5)
                                                                        contribution
"1111B0/US - Fresh wheat, corn, rice, and other grains"                        90.7%
"311210/US - Flours and malts"                                                  1.5%
"115000/US - Agriculture and forestry support"                                  0.9%
"2123A0/US - Sand, gravel, clay, phosphate, other nonmetallic minerals"         0.8%
"1111A0/US - Fresh soybeans, canola, flaxseeds, and other oilseeds"             0.8%
```

More analysis examples are available in [Example.Rmd](inst/doc/Example.Rmd).

### Compare Model Results

Comparison betwen two models can be found in [CompareModel.Rmd](inst/doc/CompareModels.Rmd).
Knit [CompareModel_render.Rmd](inst/doc/CompareModels_render.Rmd) to perform comparison on selected models (specified under the [YAML header](inst/doc/CompareModels_render.Rmd#L5)).
This will return an `.html` and a `.md` file containing comparison results for each model specified in the header. An example can be found [inst/doc/output/](inst/doc/output)

Currently, it only compares flow totals between two models. More comparisons will be added in the future.
